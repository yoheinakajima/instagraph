# InstaGraph 🌐

Hello there, adventurous coder! Welcome to InstaGraph, your go-to application for converting text or URLs into insightful knowledge graphs. Curious about the relationships between entities in a complex topic? Feed the text to InstaGraph and voila! A beautiful knowledge graph is at your fingertips.

See example flowcharts generated by InstaGraph [here](https://twitter.com/yoheinakajima/status/1701351068817301922).

Powered by OpenAI's GPT-3.5, this Flask application turns your text into a vividly colored graph, making it easier to visualize relationships between various entities. Enough talking—let's get started!

***Author's TL;DR**: If you're just looking for how the knowledge graph is generated, check out the function call parameters taking up half of main.py.*

## Installation 🛠️

To get started, you'll need Python and pip installed.

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yoheinakajima/instagraph.git
```

#### 2. Navigate to the project directory

```bash
cd instagraph
```

#### 3. Install the required Python packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### 4. Set up your OpenAI API Key

Change .env.example to .env

```text
mv .env.example .env
```

Add your OpenAI API key to .env file:

```text
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

##### Optional - Set a Graph Database

Use: `[--graph neo4j|falkordb]` to select the Graph Database driver

- Neo4J

Add Neo4J username, password and URL in the `*.env` file as well by creating an instance of [neo4j](https://neo4j.com/cloud/platform/aura-graph-database).

```text
NEO4J_USERNAME=
NEO4J_PASSWORD=
NEO4J_URI=
```

- FalkorDB

Add FalkorDB URL in the `*.env` file as well by creating an instance of [FlakorDB](https://www.falkordb.com/try-free).

```text
FALKORDB_URL=
```

#### 5. Run the Flask app

```bash
python main.py [--graph neo4j|falkordb] [--port port] [--debug]
```

Navigate to `http://localhost:8080` to see your app running.

## Run as Container

#### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yoheinakajima/instagraph.git
```

#### 2. Navigate to the project docker directory

```bash
cd instagraph/docker
```

#### 3.1 Run in Dev mode

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose-dev.yml up # Add -d flag at the end to run in background/daemon mode.
```

#### 3.2 Run in Prod - Create the docker image

- Using the `gunicorn==21.2.0` to run the application in production mode

```bash
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml up --build -d
```

## Contributing 🤝

Best way to chat with me is on Twitter at [@yoheinakajima](https://twitter.com/yoheinakajima). I usually only code on the weekends or at night, and in pretty small chunks. I have lots ideas on what I want to add here, but obviously this would move faster with everyone. Not sure I can manage Github well given my time constraints, so please reach out if you want to help me run the Github. Now, here are a few ideas on what I think we should add based on comments...
- ~~Store knowledge graph~~ (thx [@tomasonjo](https://github.com/tomasonjo)! 9/13/23)
- ~~Pull knowledge graph from storage~~ (thx [@tomasonjo](https://github.com/tomasonjo)! 9/13/23)
- Show history
- Ability to combine two graphs
- Ability to combine 2+ graphs from history
- ~~Ability to expand on a graph~~ (thx [@tomasonjo](https://github.com/tomasonjo)! 9/13/23)
- Ability to expand on graph from specific nodes
- Fuzzy matching of nodes for combining graphs (vector match + LLM confirmation)

There are a lot of "build a chart" tools out there, so instead of doing user account and custom charts, it sounds more fun for me to work on building the largest knowledge graph ever...
